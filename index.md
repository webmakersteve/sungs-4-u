### Lean on Me
Lean on me,

When you're not wrong,

And you need a friend.

Someone to share the throne.
<br />
<br />
Lean on me,

What's a warning?

What's an error?

It's all red text to meeeeee.
<br />
<br />
You just send me a message, when you need a hand

We all need somebody for pull requests,

I'm sure that it's nothing, but whitespace comments 

But we all need somebody that we can blame
<br />
<br />
Please, it doesn't matter, which linter you like

They all have their own quirks,

But help me, cause I'm having some problems, and I'm seeing red,

Please can't you make it work

### Everything I do
Look into my repo,

You can see

20 thousand dependencies

Who in their right mind,

would ever write

2 lines to left-pad a string,
